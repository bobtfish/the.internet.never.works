name: Tomas Doran
synopsis: 'Principal level Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), web and back-end development expert, architect, leader.'
profile: |
    I have extensive experience across systems, networks, and applications, particularly within LAMP stacks. My expertise enables me to develop robust web applications, optimise databases, automate deployments (applications and infrastructure), and manage complex networking, datacenter operations, and global site performance.

    My proficiency covers a wide array of programming languages and systems environments, with a strong focus on virtualization, cloud platforms, and containerization technologies. I am an active contributor to the open-source community, maintaining and developing software in multiple languages. My contributions can be found on GitHub, CPAN, RubyGems, and Puppetforge. 

    As a recognized expert in development, architecture, and systems deployment I have spoken at many events, from [small meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwWvfAGkcmg) to large industry conferences such as PuppetConf and [DockerConf 2014](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/docker-confjune2014/35717305), where I shared insights on [open-source software](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/docker-confjune2014/35717305), [system design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiJ1pmrqR7E), [writing maintainable code](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/the-worstcodei-everwrotepuppetberlin/28300312#2) and [systems architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN19sdJvR9Q).
